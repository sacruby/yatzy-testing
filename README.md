SacRuby.new Learning OOP and Testing Part 2
===========================================

This is a simple project where the solution will be to fix some bugs and
create some tests for our dice rolling game. A simple set of unit
tests are provided to start the implementation, but they don't necessarily work!

We are using Ruby's default testing library MiniTest and the 
MiniTest::Spec syntax.
